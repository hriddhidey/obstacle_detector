# obstacle_detector
Code for making a Obstacle Distance Measurement Device using an 8051 micro-controller, Ultrasonic sensor, LCD and buzzer.

The project utilises an AT89C51 IC and an 8051 development board.
The sensor utilised is an HC-SR04 sensor.
You will also need a standard 16x2 LCD module, and a Piezzo Buzzer.
Note: You may need to use a pull up resistor of around 10k ohms.
